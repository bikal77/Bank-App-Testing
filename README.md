## Description

This repository contains a set of JUnit test cases designed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Bank class functionality. The tests validate methods such as applyInterestRate, calculateInterest, deposit, and withdraw, along with the class constructor. Key scenarios include handling valid inputs, edge cases (e.g., zero or extreme values), and high-precision calculations. Mockito is used to mock dependencies and verify method interactions where applicable. Exception handling is thoroughly tested to cover invalid inputs. The suite emphasizes robust error handling and edge-case coverage. All tests are implemented using JUnit 5 standards.

**Tools Used:** `Java` `JUnit`
